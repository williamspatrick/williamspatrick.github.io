I am a software engineer currently residing in Austin, TX with my wife and 5
kids.  I am currently a software engineer at Facebook for the Hardware
Engineering organization and I spend a lot of my time working on
[OpenBMC](https://github.com/openbmc).

My views are my own and not a reflection on the opinions of any past, present,
or future employer.

Have something you'd like me to discuss?  Post an [issue](https://github.com/williamspatrick/williamspatrick.github.io/issues/new) on github.
