I am a software engineer currently residing in Austin, TX with my wife and kids.
I've worked as a software engineer for IBM on the firmware of the Power
platform since 2004.

My views are my own and not a reflection on the opinions of any past, present, or future employer.

Have something you'd like me to discuss?  Post an [issue](https://github.com/williamspatrick/williamspatrick.github.io/issues/new) on github.
