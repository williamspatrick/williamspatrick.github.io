I am a software engineer currently residing in Houghton, MI with my wife and 5
kids. I am currently a software engineer at Meta and I spend a lot of my time
working on [OpenBMC](https://github.com/openbmc).

My views are my own and not a reflection on the opinions of any past, present,
or future employer.

Have something you'd like me to discuss? Post an
[issue](https://github.com/williamspatrick/williamspatrick.github.io/issues/new)
on github.
